<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
  <p>We do not collect tracking COOKIES and only collect information that is anonymous like IP
    address, user agent string, dates and times, fingerprints and geo-location data. While this is anonymous it does provide some
    information about your ISP and possibly your computer etc. You can always opt out of providing geo-location information.
    This site uses <b>PHP</b> and the server can collect anonymous information even if you have JavaScript disables.</p>
  <p>If you have looked at our source code you have probably seen <b>tracker.js</b> and <b>geo.js</b> being loaded as
    well as <b>jquery</b>. <b>tracker.js</b> collects anonymous information and adds it to our
    databases. <b>geo.js</b> colects geo-location information if you allow and also generates a fingerprint that identifies your
    computer and browser. Both uses <b>jquery</b>.</p>
  <p>If you really want to surf the web anonymously you should go to your local library and use one
    of their computers. Do not use your email address or any other information while surfing the
    web. This is probably not the way you want to enjoy the web but it will give you a pretty
    anonymous footprint.</p>
  <p>As stated on our home page the &quot;Home Page at https://www.bartonphillips.com&quot; does not
    collect tracking COOKIES and only collects anonymous information but other pages you will link to,
    even on our domain, do collect and use JavaScript extensively.</p>

  <p>We will never sell your information (as anonymous as it is) to any third party, mainly because no one has ever asked for it and
     it has almost no value.</p>

  <p>If you want to see what information we collect visit our <a target="_blank" href="https://bartonphillips.net/webstats.php?blp=8653&site=$S->siteName">Webstats</a> page.</p>
  <p>Good luck and have fun.</p>
