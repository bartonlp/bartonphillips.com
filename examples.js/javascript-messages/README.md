# Fun with *Popups*

There are several main programs that open *popup* window. Some are PHP and others just HTML. There are a couple of Javascript programs also.
Several of the main programs actually create the *popup* in Javascript and pass data to the *popup* and the receieve data back.
Most of the programs have a *Show Source* button so you can see the source code.

Have fun and enjoy.
