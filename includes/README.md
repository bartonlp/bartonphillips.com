# Includes for the bartonphillips.com domain
The head.i.php and footer.i.php files are used by most other of my domains. Some, like bartonlp.org (at www/html), 
use the entire includes directory as a simlink while others just have head.i.php or footer.i.php symlinked.
There is now logic in these file to use elements from the mysitemap.json file for things like defaultCss and favicon.
