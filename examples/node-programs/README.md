# fs-promise

This directory has three client programs and three servers.

The 'client.html' works with the server.js. The server is run by doing 'node server.js'. The client.html runs on any browser.
The 'client.js' also works with server.js. In that case you run both programs from the command line from different terminals.
The 'client.php' can be run from any browser and it uses 'server.php'. The php model is really much simpler than the node model.
