# Programming

The pages are written in PHP and use my framework [SiteClass](https://github.com/bartonlp/site-class).
The framework provides database access and helpfull methods to simplify the repetitive tasks of
providing boiler plates for headers, footers and banners. It also provides methods for hit counting
and analysis.

All of my sites and programs are backed up on [https://github.com/bartonlp](https://github.com/bartonlp/).

This site has projects created by Barton Phillips.
