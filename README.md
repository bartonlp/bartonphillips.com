# Programming

The pages are written in PHP and use my framework [SiteClass](https://github.com/bartonlp/site-class).
The framework provides database access and helpfull methods to simplify the repetitive tasks of
providing boiler plates for headers, footers and banners. It also provides methods for hit counting
and analysis.

This site has projects created by Barton Phillips.
                                                          
# ARTICLES

I have created an * articles*  directory and have moved all of the * __Helpful Programs and Tips__* 
programs into that directory. This is an attempt to clean up the directory structure.
